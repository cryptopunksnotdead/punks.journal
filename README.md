Reminder:  Dear [James Edward Gray II](https://twitter.com/JEG2), We love you. We thank you for your code.
You're a genius. You're beautiful. [We stand on your shoulders. You're a giant.¹](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)
Please, please, please - these articles are NOT about you.
It's about the code and how to fix it.

>  I'm seeing from you is that we should not consider people's feelings when criticizing their work. [...]
>  Please take time to sit down [..] and offer an apology to the author of the CSV library.
